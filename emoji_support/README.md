# Emoji Support

This add-on makes the necessary changes to an existing ExpressionEngine install's database so that it will support emoji! ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements

- ExpressionEngine 3+
- PHP 5.4+

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/Emoji-Support/releases/latest).
2. Copy the `emoji_support` folder to your `system/user/addons` folder (you can ignore the rest of this repository's files).
3. In your ExpressionEngine control panel, visit the Add-On Manager and click Install next to "Emoji Support".

## Instructions

Visit the Emoji Support add-on in your control panel, and follow the onscreen instructions (including making a database backup!). Click to run. Party time! ðŸŽŠðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

### Third-party table warnings

The add-on will perform a pre-flight check to make sure that your environment can support emoji, as well as check if any third-party database tables need to be modified before the conversion can run. If you get a warning that some tables need modifying before you can convert your database for emoji support, you should contact the developer who created the table for instructions.

**Warning: technical content ahead!**

Emoji and other 4-byte characters take up, well, 4 bytes each instead of 3 bytes like other characters. Character limits in MySQL are expressed in terms of 3-byte characters, so a character limit of 255 can only actually store 191 4-byte characters (255 * 3 / 4). Maths, oy.

This is normally fine, except where table indexes are concerned. If a column has a char/text-based index in MySQL, MySQL needs to be instructed to only use a max of 191 characters for the key. You can often fix this yourself using the typical pattern:

```
DROP INDEX `column_name` ON `exp_my_table`;,
CREATE INDEX `column_name` ON `exp_my_table` (`column_name`(191));
```

It's always good idea to check with the developer though, as it is possible that this modification would have unintended consequences depending on how the add-on is using those keys.

## Additional Files
